## Description
This tool enables any non-public blockchain instance to interact with the Oraclize service.

_Please note that at this point this tool is still **experimental** and subject to change without notice._

### Requirements
- node version **>= 5.0.0** (& npm)

#### Note
(on Ubuntu)

run `sudo apt-get install build-essential -y`

You should run the following commands from within the ethereum-bridge folder.

### Install

via git
```
git clone https://github.com/oraclize/ethereum-bridge.git
cd ethereum-bridge
npm install
```

via npm
```
npm install -g ethereum-bridge
```

### How to use

You have 2 options:
 * [active mode](#active-mode) (deploy and query contracts using one account on your main node) [DEFAULT]
 * [broadcast mode](#broadcast-mode) (deploy and query contracts using a local account (the node will be used only to broadcast the txs))

After you have correctly deployed the address resolver and the connector on your blockchain you can load the previous instance using the `--oar` flag (with the latest oar address generated) or using `--instance latest`


**if you are not using the deterministic OAR** you also need to [update your contract constructor](#add-a-custom-address-resolver) with the new address resolver generated

see also [optional flags](#optional-flags)

#### Active mode

```
ethereum-bridge -H localhost:8545 -a 1
```
(deploy contracts using the account 1 found on the localhost:8545 node)


#### Broadcast mode

Generate a new local address:

```
ethereum-bridge -H localhost:8545 --broadcast --new
```
(generate a new address locally and deploy contracts (txs broadcasted to localhost:8545 node))

or if you already have one or more account in your keys.json file:

```
ethereum-bridge -H localhost:8545 --broadcast -a 0
```
(load the first account in your keys.json file (index n.0) and deploy contracts (txs broadcasted to localhost:8545 node))


#### Add a custom address resolver

Add `OAR = OraclizeAddrResolverI(EnterYourOarCustomAddress);` to your contract constructor, example:

Where `EnterYourOarCustomAddress` is the address resolver generated when you have run the script
```
contract test() {
    ...

    function test() {
      // this is the constructor
      OAR = OraclizeAddrResolverI(0xf0f20d1a90c618163d762f9f09baa003a60adeff);
    }

    ...
}
```


**Note:** The address chosen will be used to deploy all the Oraclize contracts, **make sure to not deploy contracts that use Oraclize on the same address.**


### How to update the bridge

If a new version is detected you can run `npm run update` to automatically donwload and install the latest version from github.



### Optional flags

* optional:
  * `--broadcast --new` : generate a new local address (private key automatically saved in ./config/instance/keys.json), and deploy contracts using the new address
  * `--broadcast` : enable offline tx signing (your node will be used to broadcast the raw transaction) **the broadcast mode will load your local keys.json file**
  * `-a` : change the default account used to deploy and call the transactions (account index and hex address are allowed) i.e:
    * `-a 0` : use account 0 on localhost:8545
    * `-a 0x123456 --broadcast` : load and use account 0x123456 (public-key) in your keys.json file (broadcast mode)
    * `-a 0 --broadcast` : use account at index n. 0 in your keys.json file (broadcast mode)
  * `--instance` : load a previous configuration file (filename) you can also use 'latest' to load the latest confiuration file, i.e. `--instance oracle_instance_1483441110.json` or `--instance latest`
  * `--from` `--to` : load and process logs starting --from (fromBlock) and --to (toBlock)  ('latest' is not allowed)  i.e. `--from 27384 --to 27387`
  * `--oar` : to specify the OAR address already deployed i.e. `--oar 0xEnterYourOarCustomAddress`
  * `-H` : change the default node (localhost:8545)
  * `-p` : change the default PORT (8545) on localhost
  * `--url` : change the default node with an url (http://localhost:8545)
  * `--key` : change the default key path (./config/instance/keys.json) i.e. `--key /home/user/keys.json`
  * `--gas` : change the default gas limit (3000000) used to deploy contracts
  * `--resume` : resume all skipped queries
  * `--skip` : skip all pending queries
  * `--dev` : skip contract myid check and pending queries (useful for local testing)
  * `--disable-deterministic-oar` : Deploy the address resolver (OAR) with your main account (note: you need to update your contract with the new generated address)
  * `--price-usd` : set the USD base price
  * `--price-update-interval` : set the baseprice update interval time (in seconds), ETH price will be fetched from the Oraclize HTTP API
  * `--random-ds-update-interval` : set the random ds hash list update interval time (in seconds)
  * `--disable-price` : skip datasource pricing and base price connector update (only on new instances)
  * `--disable-reorg` : disable re-org block listen
  * `--update-ds` : update datasource pricing only (pricing (if found) will be loaded from your local instance file, otherwise will be fetched from the remote oraclize API)
  * `--loglevel` : change the default log level (available: 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'verbose', 'debug', 'stats') default: 'info'
  * `--non-interactive` : disable the interactive mode
  * `--no-hints` : disable logs hints
  * `--gasprice` : set custom gas price
